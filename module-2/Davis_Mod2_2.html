    <h1>Assignment 2.2 - Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
	<h2>A Bit About Me! </h2>
	<p class="intro"> My name is Torren Marquise Davis, and I was born and raised on the south side of Chicago, Illinois. When I
	became a teenager, I moved out of the city, and moved to the Northwest Indiana region. To this day, I still live
	there, just outside of the city I was born in.</p>
	<p> There are quite a few hobbies I find myself enjoying, time and time again. Firstly, I enjoy drawing and writing, 
	as well as playing many different video games. I use these hobbies to express myself, and enjoy time with my friends.</p>
	<p> Currently, I am aiming to learn programming to the best of my abilities, and for multiple reasons. Firstly, I
	would like to use the skill to aid myself in getting a higher quality job in the field of software and/or technology.
	<span class="sentence">However, my ulterior motive is to further my skills in game development, for my own personal projects.</span></p>
	<p> School after high school has been a tiresome journey for me. I've been in around 4-5 different colleges/universities
	at this point, and still haven't gotten my bachelor's degree. Hopefully Bellevue will be where the journey ends.</p>
